1 you might need to create a new project through GAMS

2 main function 
2.1) iv_acopf_reformulation_xke.gms
this formulation add absolute value (penalty term) in objective function to handle the infeasibility issue
2.2) iv_acopf_reformulation_lop_adj.gms
this formulation ause three step method to handle the infeasibility issue

data are extracted from file
extract_data_SunLamp_newformulation_cle.gms

The constraints are written in the main function
iv_acopf_reformulation_xke.gms

The objective are written in 
objective_voltage_stability_addterm.gms (for 2.1)
objective_voltage_stability_addterm_absolute_penalty.gms (for 2.2)

To run the switched shunt model, do:

  gams iv_acopf_reformulation_xke.gms --do_switched_shunts=1

To use a different switched shunt data set, e.g. foo.gms, do:

  gams iv_acopf_reformulation_xke.gms --do_switched_shunts=1 --switched_shunt_data=foo.gms
